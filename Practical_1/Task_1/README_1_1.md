# Assignment 1: Personalized Greeting Generator

## Objective
Write a Python function that generates a personalized greeting message for a given name.

## Instructions
- Implement the function `personalized_greeting(name)`.
- The function should return a string in the format:

`Hello, <name>! Welcome to the Python course.`

- Example:
```python
personalized_greeting("Aditya")
# Output: "Hello, Aditya! Welcome to the Python course."
```

## How to check your solution
In the CLI, go to the working directory and type `python`/`python3`. Now, to open your file, type
```
from student_code_1_1 import *
```
This means that all the functions are imported from file `student_code_1_1.py`

## How to Run Autograder:
1. Save your solution in `student_code_1_1.py`.
2. Run the autograder with the command:
       `python ./autograder_1_1.py`
       or
       `python3 ./autograder_1_1.py`
3. Check the output for your score and feedback.

### Notes:
- Do not change the file and function names
