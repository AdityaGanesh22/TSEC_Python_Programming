# Assignment 4: Calculating Gross Salary of an Employee

## Objective
Write a Python function to calculate the gross salary of an employee.

## Instructions
- Implement the following function in `student_code_1_4.py`:
  1. `calculate_gross_salary(basic_salary)`
     - DA = 70% of basic salary
     - TA = 30% of basic salary
     - HRA = 10% of basic salary
     - Gross Salary = BS + DA + TA + HRA

- The function should return the gross salary as a float.

- Examples:
```python
calculate_gross_salary(1000)
# Output: 2100.0

calculate_gross_salary(5000)
# Output: 10500.0
```
